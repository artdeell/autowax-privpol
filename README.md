# Privacy policy of AutoWax
The application that you are using (or will be using) does not send any usage data or anything else to me. I have no idea what are you doing with my app on my own.<br />However, it does send your device model and Android version to Sky servers to conform with the protocol requirements <br /><br />
However, Google (the distributor of the application) does collect crash stack traces and send them to me anonymously. To learn more about that, consider reading Google's own privacy policy.
